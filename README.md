## Introduction
Climate change induces the probability of occurring natural disasters; e.g.
floods, Sea Level Rise, Green House Gases. Flood is considered one of the
most dangerous phenomena that tremendously and dramatically threatening
the human being and environment worldwide. Rapid urban growth,
demographic explosion, and unplanned land uses have exacerbated the
problem of urban flooding, particularly in the cities of China.
The main objective of this project is to investigate the flood risk
analysis and assessment based on flood simulation and adaptive strategies for
flood event through two case studies of Changsha city in south-central China
